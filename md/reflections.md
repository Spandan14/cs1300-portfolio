### Part 1

## mouse inputs

### chrome
a single click on the URL will move the cursor there
double click will select the term
triple click will select the whole URL 

When searching, mouse doesn't do much other than click button to delete recent search from results
or to navigate to the shown search. No option to load the URL to edit with the mouse

### VSC
a single click will move the cursor to the location
double click will select the word
triple click will select the whole line

When searching, mouse doesn't do much other than click buttons for various actions, or to click 
the item. Some items that require more input just fill the bar and then repeat the cycle, which
is useful

## GitHub
a single click will move the cursor to the location
double click will select the word
triple click will select the whole line

When searching, mouse doesn't do much other than click buttons for various search options, but 
the domain-specific like repo-specific or org-specific search just executes the search instead of 
providing the option to edit the search/provide additional queries. But it does give a hint as to 
what the action will do.

## Keyboard inputs
### chrome
Typing triggers the auto-completion which gives suggestions, first recent options and then more suggestions

Enter key is used to select the option and perform the action/navigation
Tab key is used to move to the next action (either the suggestion or some action buttons)

Up/Down moves only between suggestions

Typing when you have a suggestion selected will add to the text, and give new suggestions.

### VSC
Typing triggers auto-completion for files, but for actions you need to type >. This might be a bit
counter-intuitive, and it would be nice to have either tabs or a different search bar entirely.

Enter key is used to select and perform the action 
Tab key is very out of sync, and does a lot of random things

Up/Down moves between suggestions 

Typing when you have a suggestion selected will add to the search box

### GitHub
Typing triggers auto-completion and gives suggestions

Enter key is used to navigate to the selected options
Tab key is used to move to the next section of the UI, and not the next option 

Up/Down moves between suggestions. But this doesn't actually load the suggestion in the search bar so you can't do much or edit it

Typing when you have a suggestion selected will add to the search box
